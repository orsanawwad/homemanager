# HomeManager

In order to run this project
```
git clone git@github.com:orsanawwad/homemanager.git
cd homemanager
./gradlew check #./gradlew.bat on windows
./gradlew run
```

Then use either VSCode or Intellij, use branches and do not push directly to master.

In Intellij, open the project, wait for it to finish indexing, open the gradle tap, Tasks -> application -> run

Afterwards you should be able to debug the build
